# Federated-HeartCare
Federated HeartCare is a cutting-edge heart disease prediction system leveraging the power of Federated Learning, implemented using the Flower framework. This open-source project aims to revolutionize healthcare analytics by seamlessly aggregating insights from decentralized numeric datasets in CSV format.

# Flower Framework
A Friendly Federated Learning Framework. It (flwr) is a framework for building federated learning systems.

# Strategy [FedAvg]

FLower baseline used in this project is - [FedAvg](https://github.com/adap/flower/tree/main/baselines/flwr_baselines/flwr_baselines/publications/fedavg_mnist)
For communication efficient federated learning implementation in healthcare to predict the possibility of heartdiseases if any..

Federated Averaging, often abbreviated as FedAvg, is a state-of-the-art collaborative learning approach designed to train machine learning models across a decentralized network of devices while preserving data privacy. This method is particularly useful in scenarios where the data is sensitive, distributed, and cannot be centralized for training due to privacy concerns.
Key Concepts:
Decentralized Training
Local model updates
Model aggregation
Privacy preservation
Communication efficiency
